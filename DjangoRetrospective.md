As of today the status of my Djorg Application is as follows:
    * MVP  of the apps worked on together is complete
    * 3rd party oauth was attempted- not working as intended
    * MVP of 2 new apps added
    * deployment was not successful

    Over the past three days my goal was to add 2 new apps to the Djorg project and change the theme to one that reflected my interests.
(Day1) I started by switching the theme to "Djorg-Fit" - with hopes to tweak the existing project to one that focused on organization for keeping track of and blogging about ones fitness journey. Since the  Bookmarks App was already at MVP status I decided to start there and just changed the name to Fit-Links- same concept as bookmarks just a name change to fit the new theme. I then followed the same format as our bookmarks app to add a new app called contacts. I then added bootstrap to make the aplication more visually appealing. 
(Day2) Next I attempted to add the notes MVP frontend to the project- I had alot of trouble trying to hook the back end up to the React front end for  notes while trying to keep the html/bootstrap base for contacts and ultimately decided that it would have to wait. I moved on and added an api for a new app "blog".
(Day 3) I contined working on the new app blog- and got it to the same status as notes. I then Attempted to add 3rd party oauth/ and read about updating a existing deployment on Heroku - After trying to deploy I recieved an Application Error.
(Future Plans for Djorg-Fit)- I have now decided that I should probably make a React frontend for the entire project. Once this is finished I plan to get all four applications working and visually appealing. If I continue to pursue this project I also intend to add a feature where the users can write blog posts about their fitness journey that other users can view and "like". I intend to keep the notes, bookmarks and contacts a user adds for their view only. I have also thought about adding a workout planner(something along the lines of mixing a notes app  with a todo lists app)- User would be able to create a new workout plan and toggle the items on it as completed.
