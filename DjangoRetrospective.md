I completed Bookmarks and was able to run it locally, but not able to successfully deploy it. I added a bit of graphql and 3rd party oAuth to the Notes app and was making progress, but lost a couple days due to being sick and some power outages. So, I was playing catch up, which is hard when things are moving fast, but I got some parts of all MVP apps to work, but could not deploy because they weren't all complete. I didn't get far into adding in my own app besides the initial stages. With more time, I want to go back and successfully deploy Bookmarks and Notes. I'd then like to add a file storage app of my own. I will be adding Notes to this, but for now I just added the bookmarks app. I need to redo some things in Notes. I was happy to get in some time with working on 3rd party oAuth outside of this project when I was exploring it deeper. Looking forward to returning to this and finish adding my own app. - Alif
