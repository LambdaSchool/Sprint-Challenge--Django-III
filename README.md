# Sprint-Challenge--Django-III

You've worked with Django a lot, the sprint challenge is - put it all together!
Your task is to open a PR to this repo with a file `DjangoRetrospective.md` that
answers the following questions:

- Link to your Djorg repo, deployed site, and a summary of your status:
   https://damp-mountain-56429.herokuapp.com
   https://github.com/padjo/timeTracking.git
     This is a timer app
    - Did you reproduce the MVP apps we worked on together?
     I followed along to a book Fullstack react to create a fairly interactive timers app
    - Did you add 3rd party oauth?
       Unfortunately i didn't get that far but i hope to get back and add it in 
    - How far did you get in adding your own app?
       whith the help of a book quite far. I was ofter very frustrated trying to troubleshoot error after error this pas while. 
- Describe the design of the app you added:
    It's the classic function component based react app with a main list composing sublists . 
    - What data/models did you write?
        State was written out to a json file so that when you revisit the app , it still runs and remembers it's state. I need to introduce a database (sql or mongoose )
    - What packages did you use?
        react/axios
    - What features did you add?
      create/Add/delete/edit timers . 

Feel free to describe both what you did build as well as what you'd like to
build with more time (be clear which is which). The main goal is an MVP that
shows you know how to build complete basic Django apps, but ideas and plans to
take it further are great and good to practice your technical writing.

You can use the sprint challenge time to actually work on Djorg and get it as
far as you are able, but you do need to turn in this writing so it is suggested
you start writing by the early afternoon. We're looking forward to see what you
built - thanks for your hard work!
